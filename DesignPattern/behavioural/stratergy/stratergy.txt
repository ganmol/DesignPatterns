Use Composition( Has A ) instead of Inheritance (Is A);

When we cannot create hearachi solutions ,  when property A is not shared downwards (Parent - child) , 

property A must be shared between siblings  only .

Make interface of property A (Has A relatioshp is established ), so that every child can implement property A accordingly .

Stratergy :


Interface can be better than sub class
