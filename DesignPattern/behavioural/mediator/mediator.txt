it avoids direct refrences to communicate with objects.

so we introduec a mediator (interface)with connects two objects

promotes oosely coupled communication between objects .


 objects are not aware of the existence of other objects.
 
  Objects depend only on a single mediator class ,
 instead of being coupled to dozens of other objects.
 
 
 Mediator ==>  interface for communication between Colleague objects.
 
ConcreteMediator == implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between Colleague objects. 
It is aware of all of the Colleagues and their purposes with regards to inter-communication.


.Colleague =  interface for communication with other Colleagues through its Mediator/
ConcreteColleague  -= implements the Colleague interface and communicates with other Colleagues through its Mediator

communication is

ConcreteColleague -> IColleague  -> IMediator -> ConcreteMediator
