Law of least Knowledge (law of demeter )
talk to nearest (immediate ) friend , not friends of friends (a.b is allowed but a.b.c is not allowed )

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem

set of interfaces  are complex to use b'coz 
Object obj = new Obj1(new objct(new Object3(new Object 4(new Object 5))));

to avoid this we use facade a iterface
