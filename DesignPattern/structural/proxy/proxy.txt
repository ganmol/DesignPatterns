access related objects s

Types of ways proxy is used to control access   can be called 

1.Remote proxy == used when resource need to be accesed is remote (different namespace , different server)
	so interaction with different server / namesapce to be save and thus wrapped into a proxy .
	
	proxy -> interacts with remote resource and returns a promise (response from extrnal resource)


2. virtual proxy ==  controls access to resource which is expensive to create
		(	caching )

3. protection proxy ==  checks for only users that are allowed to access resource can access it .
